# HPCC-Builds-Improvement
 The HPCC Systems platform, hosted on GitHub, used Jenkins for CI/CD automation. GitHub Actions now simplifies building, testing, and deploying. To migrate from Jenkins to GitHub Actions, replace a web service with a bash script that receives an HPCC Systems version, parses package files, and returns metadata in JSON format.
